# To-Do App

This is a simple to-do app with a Node.js backend and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```sh
   cd backend

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install

3. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```sh
   cd frontend

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Features

```vbnet
This setup provides a basic to-do app. The backend uses Express to handle API requests, and the frontend interacts with the backend via fetch API calls. This structure can be expanded with more features and error handling as needed.
